# OS-Simulator
A web application to simulate many well known OS processes along with a user-friendly UI

HOW TO RUN IT   
First, download the folder form Google Drive to a local machine.  
Next, open the file index.html in a web browser.  
Once opened, scroll down and choose a simulation by clicking it.  

The available features are:
1) Process Scheduling      
It includes 3 algorithms namely FCFS, SJF and RR.

2) Process Synchronisation    
It includes algorithms to solve well known problems like Dining Philosophers and Sleeping Barber. It also contains other simulations.

3) Deadlocks    
It includes a simulation of Banker's Algorithm.

4) Memory Management  
It includes multiprogramming with fixed(MFT) and variable(MVT) number of tasks. Each in turn contain algorithms for first, best and worst fit.

5) Disc Scheduling     
It includes many disc scheduling algorithms.

6) Page Replacement    
It includes a simulation of well known page replacement algorithms.

7) File Allocation    
It includes sequential, indexed, and linked allocation algorithms.
